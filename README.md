# Levy-Stable-Estimators
Open source library of tools for estimating univariate levy-stable parameters such as tail, quantile, ECF and approximate MLE methods

* **QuantilesEstimator.py** estimates all 4 stable parameters based on quantiles of stable distributions, implementing the tabular method 
described in McCullouch, J.H. 1986. "Simple consistent estimators of stable distribution parameters"

A work in progress!
